# Crossword

Following an interesting conversation with my father, I attempted to make this
crossword in order to play around with puzzlemaking as a whole.

However, the entire project was relatively tedious from start to finish. I
utilized [Crosserville](https://www.crosserville.com/) to help fill in the
blanks, but as I was manually creating the HTML site itself, I spent a genuinely
_ridiculous_ amount of time setting up the board. I'm sure I could have written
tools to automate that process; However, that would have been infeasibly long as
well.

The crossword is designed out of a QR code, which actually stands in as one of
the major clues. I'm quite happy with how it turned out, and I think if I did
not work with the limitation of writing it myself, I would have enjoyed it
significantly more.
